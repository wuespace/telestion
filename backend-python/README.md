# Telestion Python Backend

This repository contains everything to build Telestion backend services in Python.
Additional examples help in setting everything up.

The Python backend is mainly added to allow for easier interfacing with many scientific libraries, such as numpy,
scipy, tensorflow or pytorch.
Creating static graphs with Matplotlib that can be rendered in the frontend could also be created.
