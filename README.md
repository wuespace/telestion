[![DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10407142](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10407142.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10407142)

**The best framework for mission control and ground station software.**

Telestion is a modern, polyglot, microservice-based framework that provides everything you need to build sophisticated ground station and mission control applications.

## Key Features

üåê **Polyglot**: Write services in TypeScript/Deno, Go, or any language with NATS support  
üîß **Microservice Architecture**: Independent, scalable services communicating via NATS message bus  
üìä **End-to-End Solution**: From data acquisition to visualization  
üöÄ **Production Ready**: Battle-tested in real aerospace projects  
üíª **Modern Stack**: Vite, React, Deno, Go - best-in-class developer experience  

## Quick Start

Check out our [end-to-end demo](examples/end-to-end-demo/README.md) to see Telestion in action with multiple services working together.

## Architecture

Telestion follows a microservice architecture where services communicate via a NATS message bus. Services can be written in different languages and deployed independently. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.
